    <h1>Antisocial Network Response</h1>
    <p>I think that the antisocial network talks about a dangerous part of the internet that we don't interact with everyday. I haven't heard of most of the websites or groups that they talked about in the video. When I heard it for the first time it all seemed pretty crazy but I can see why people would believe in them after hearing about it.</p>
    <p>The film shows how easily misinformation can spread online and how people can get drawn into echo chambers without realizing it. It was surprising to see how some of these groups formed communities built around false ideas or conspiracy theories. The documentary also makes you think about how social media algorithms and anonymity can make these spaces even more powerful and scarier than it already is. I think that it felt like a warning about how the internet can influence people's thinking when there are few checks on what's true or false.</p>
