      <p>
        I was struggling a bit at the start but I think that for my week two website I started figuring things out and it became really fun. 
        I also started learning a lot more. A highlight from that week was creating a button through css.

        For my week 3 website, I found how challenging design can be. 
        I realized for this class I would also need to take the design into account and not just focus on the code.

      <p>
        In Week 5 for my Ways of Seeing Response I started to try and incorporate some animation. 
        It was hard to understand at first so I started off with something easy. 
        It made me realize that there can be a lot of things done through animation and that I should keep exploring what I can do with animation.

    <div class="container">
    <img src="JS.png">
      <p>
        Week 6 was when js was introduced. I had a really hard time understanding how js worked at first and even now, I sometimes still can't really understand it well.
        I know that there is a lot that can be done in js and I want to try and explore more ways to use it in my final.
