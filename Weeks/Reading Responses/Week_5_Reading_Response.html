          I found episode 3 and 4 interesting and I can relate some of the things Berger said in the video to today’s world. In episode 3, he talked about how owning oil paintings became a status symbol and it was a way to show wealth and taste. Paintings were becoming more about owning them than about the paintings itself. It made me think that it’s all about things like limited runs of items and digital art like NFTS. There’s this idea of exclusivity and people might see that as a symbol of wealth and status. Berger also mentions that the way we interpret images depends heavily on how, when, and where we see them. He says that the aura of a painting is also different with and without a frame. This idea of a frame making so much of a difference is interesting to me because I thought that our phones act like digital frames. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok influence how we see images and things like filters and how it’s cropped can change how we interpret those images.

          In episode 4 Berger talks about art not only being controlled by artists but political and social forces as well. Having political or social power can determine who sees what, where it's shown, and how they are seen. This reminds me of social media where algorithms decide what content we see and who sees them. Berger also talks about museums as a sign of authority, elite culture, and status. A painting in a gallery is given status just by being in the space itself. I think that in today’s world, social media platforms act like museums. For example, they decide who gets verified and gets a blue check, what kind of content is getting censored or shown — social media platforms have the authority over all these things. At first, I didn’t think that I could relate or understand what Berger was talking about in the videos. After giving it some thought I realized that the things he talked about could be related back to our world today and it made what he talks about in the videos more interesting.
