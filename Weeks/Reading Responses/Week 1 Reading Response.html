            <p style = color:black;>In Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think”, he imagines future technology like the “memex” machine to help people better manage and access the huge amount of information produced by modern science. 
                This makes them easier to find and use. 
                His ideas predicted things like computers, hypertext, and the internet. 
                In addition, he hoped that scientists would use the new technoloies to benefit society rather than just war. This vision still feels inspiring and surprisingly modern.
                I think its preety cool to see his predictions in the world today.<p>
