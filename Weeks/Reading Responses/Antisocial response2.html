    <h1>Antisocial Network Response</h1>
    <p>The documentary also looks at how internet communities like 4chan changed over time, sometimes moving from joke filled spaces to groups with real political influence. The documentary also drives home how internet culture can blur the line between humor and harm. It was pretty interesting to see how actions that started as just trolling or playing around online could become something much more serious and even harmful in the real world. Especially like the connection to events like the January 6th insurrection makes it clear that ideas and movements from these corners of the internet don't just stay online, they can spill out into society.</p>
    <p>I found the part where the film followed the stories of different users and groups interesting. The film shows how these people often get caught up because they want to feel part of something or make a difference, even if the outcome isn't always positive. It’s also interesting that some people featured in the documentary regret their past actions or seem unaware of just how much impact they had, both good and bad. In the end, the movie suggests it's important to think critically about what we see online and remember there's more to life than what happens on the internet.</p>
    <p>The film left me with an unsettling realization that the movements, memes, and conspiracies that shaped much of the past decade often arose as accidents or as part of an ongoing quest for attention and influence. The message at the end, especially from the former 4chan founder, is clear that recovering from these deep internet rabbit holes means disengaging from the chaos and taking time to reconnect with reality. While not everyone is deep into internet rabbit holes, I do believe that most of the people will benefit from spending less time on the internet and spending some time in the real world.</p>
