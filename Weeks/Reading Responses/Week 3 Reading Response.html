                To be completely honest, I was a bit confused with the reading. 
                However, there are bits and pieces throughout the reading that I find 
                interesting and can understand. One of the things that resonated with me was the "Age of Anxiety". 
                I liked the way that Marshall McLuhan put it, "the result of trying to do today's job with 
                yesterday's tools-with yesterday's concepts." As the world advances, our methods and ways of doing
                things also needs to evolve. Some people have an easier time adapting than others but eventually
                we all need to adapt.
